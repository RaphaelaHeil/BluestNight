# BluestNight
A dark theme with blue accents for Hugo. Provides multiple configuration options and overrides.

This theme is a complete recreation of my previous theming attempt [Darkroad](https://github.com/Shadow53/Darkroad) based on [Mainroad by Vimux](https://github.com/vimux/mainroad). The theme is similar only in basic structure and has been recreated from scratch.

# Documentation

You can find documentation on how to use the theme, as well as a `config.toml` [template](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/BluestNight/config.toml.example), on the [example site](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/BluestNight/)

# Example sites
See the theme in action with its custom color scheme [here](https://mnbryant.com) or with an override [here](https://shadow53.com)
