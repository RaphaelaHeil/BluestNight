# BluestNight

A featureful, configurable, yet sleek dark theme for Hugo.

This theme is a complete recreation of my previous theming attempt [Darkroad](https://github.com/Shadow53/Darkroad) based on [Mainroad by Vimux](https://github.com/vimux/mainroad). The theme is similar only in basic structure and has been recreated from scratch with many improvements
